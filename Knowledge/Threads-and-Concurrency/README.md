## Threads & Concurrency - Notes

A ***thread*** is a program that runs in the same **address space** with other ***threads***.

***Threading*** allows for processes to run in parallel *(but not really)* in the same **address space**.

Example for the use of ***threads***:

    Let's say we have a text editor.
    Had we used only 1 thread, it would be impossible to take input from the keyboard as the editor auto-saves our changes.
    Just using independent processes would not solve this issue as each process would belong to a different address space.
Thankfully, ***C#*** is said to have excellent multithreading capabilities.

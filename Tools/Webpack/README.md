## Module bundlers

A module bundler is a tool that takes pieces of JavaScript and their dependencies and bundles them into a single file.

A website is built using multiple tools.
For example, JavaScript, HTML, CSS would be considered the bare minimum.
However, things are a lot more complicated nowadays for a complete website to be built and many languages, tools and libraries are usually needed. To combine them all for optimization and to make sure they all work together is a difficult task. That's where Module bundlers come in.

A module bundler, basically, bundles all the assets used together.

## Webpack - Notes

For test,

- Create a project and make a file ***index.js*** inside a folder ***src***
- Open a terminal in that project's folder and type

  ```bash
  npm init -y
  ```

  to create a ***package.json*** file
- Install a module for testing

  ```bash
  npm i lodash
  ```

- Create a folder ***public*** inside the project's folder and create ***index.html*** file inside this folder and paste

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
      <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
          <title>Document</title>

          <script src="../src/index.js"></script>
      </head>
      <body>

      </body>
  </html>
  ```

- Inside the ***index.js*** file, paste

  ```javascript
  import { camelCase } from 'lodash';

  console.log(camelCase('hello world'));
  ```

If you open ***index.html*** with a browser and head to the console, you'll notice an error.

- Open a terminal in the project's folder and type

  ```bash
  npm i --save-dev webpack-cli webpack
  ```

  to install ***Webpack***
- Open the ***package.json*** file and paste

  ```json
  "build": "webpack"
  ```

  inside the "*scripts*" section
- Open a terminal in the project's folder and type

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  to compile our code
- Now, inside the ***index.html***, change the script src attribute like so

  ```html
  <script src="../dist/main.js"></script>
  ```

If you head back to the browser and open the console, you will see a '***helloWorld***' being printed successfully.

It is very important to know that ***Webpack*** is currently using the **DEFAULT** configuration which means that it is specifically looking for the ***index.js*** file inside the ***src*** folder. However, in some cases, you will want/need to configure ***Webpack*** yourself.

- Create a ***webpack.config.js*** file inside our project's folder and paste

  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    entry: './src/index.js',
  };
  ```

  Notice, to include many entry points (this is called **CODE SPLITTING**) you need

  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    entry: {
      foo: 'foo.js',
      bar: 'bar.js'
    },
  };
  ```

  More options, for example, **output**

  ```javascript
  const path = require('path');

  module.exports = {
    entry: './src/index.js',
    output: {
      filename: 'awesome.js',
      path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
    },
  };
  ```

### Include SASS

- Inside the ***src*** folder, create a file ***style.scss*** and paste your desired or even random ***SCSS*** code

  ```scss
  $text: orange;
  $bg: black;

  body {
    color: $text;
    background: $bg;
  }
  ```

- Include it in the ***index.js*** file

  ```javascript
  import './style.scss';
  ```

Now, notice that if you try to build with

```bash
npm run build
```

an error will occure. That's because we do not have a loader for our ***SASS***.

To solve this, simply open a terminal in the project's folder and type

```bash
npm install --save-dev css-loader style-loader sass-loader sass
```

- Include the modules in the ***webpack.config.js*** file, inside the *"module.exports"* section. The end result should look like this

  ```javascript
  const path = require('path');

  module.exports = {
    entry: './src/index.js',
    output: {
      filename: 'main.js',
      path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
    },
    module: {
      rules: [
        {
          test: /\.scss$/,
          use: [
            'style-loader',
            'css-loader',
            'sass-loader'
          ],
        },
      ],
    },
  };
  ```

### Analyze bundle (using plugins)

- Open a terminal in the project's folder and type

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-analyzer
  ```

- Paste

  ```javascript
  const BundleAnalyzerPlugin = require('webpack-bundle-analyzer').BundleAnalyzerPlugin;
  ```

  in the ***webpack.config.js*** file, outside of the *"module.exports"* section and

  ```javascript
  plugins: [
    new BundleAnalyzerPlugin()
  ],
  ```

  inside the section.
- When you build, you should see this screen

  ![webpack-bundle-analyzer](/Images/webpack-bundle-analyzer.png)

### Setup local web server

- Open a terminal in the project's folder and type

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server
  ```

- In the ***webpack.config.js*** file, outside of the *"module.exports"* section, paste

  ```javascript
  devServer: {
    contentBase: path.join(__dirname, 'public'),
    port: 9000
  },
  ```

- Open the ***package.json*** file and paste

  ```json
  "dev": "webpack serve"
  ```

  inside the *"scripts"* section
- Start server by typing

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

  inside the terminal

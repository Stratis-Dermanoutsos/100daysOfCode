# 100 DAYS OF CODE

This is a challenge and way for me to give my all and acquire practical knowledge and skills. The goal is to complete the TODO list in the [GOALS](./README.md#GOALS) section.

Hopefully, by the end of this challenge, I will have the skills to get a job and know what I am doing!

## Days - Knowledge gained

### 1

- ***HTTP*** means ***HyperText Transfer Protocol***
- ***HTTP***, as a request-response protocol, gives users a way to interact with web resources such as HTML files by transmitting hypertext messages between clients and servers
- ***HTTP*** is a method for encoding and transporting information between a client (such as a web browser) and a web server
- ***HTTP*** requests are:
  - ***CONNECT***: The ***CONNECT*** method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.
  - ***DELETE***: The ***DELETE*** method deletes the specified resource.
  - ***GET***: The ***GET*** method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using ***GET*** should only retrieve data.
  - ***HEAD***: The ***HEAD*** method asks for a response identical to that of a ***GET*** request, but without the response body.
  - ***OPTIONS***: The ***OPTIONS*** method is used to describe the communication options for the target resource.
  - ***PATCH***: The ***PATCH*** method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
  - ***POST***: The ***POST*** method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
  - ***PUT***: The ***PUT*** method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
  - ***TRACE***: The ***TRACE*** method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.
- I made basic ***API*** in ***C#***
  - Project is called ***BirthdayAPI***

### 2

- Basics of ***JavaScript*** (from ***[Speaking JavaScript](http://speakingjs.com)***)
- ***obj.propKey = value*** and ***obj['propKey'] = value*** are equal
- if ***1 = 0001***, then ***~1 = 1110***
- ***'abc'.charAt(1)*** and  ***'abc'[1]*** are equal, tho some older browsers don't support the latter
- Comparing strings
  - is case-sensitive

        > 'B' > 'A' // true
        > 'B' > 'a' // false
  - doesn't handle umlauts and accents well

        > 'b' > 'Ã¤' // false
- ***C#*** vs ***JavaScript*** (only notable differences/similarities as I am used to writing code in ***C#***)

# Full-Stack Roadmap 2021

This is a repository holding information and resources for everyone interested in becoming a Full-Stack Web Developer in 2021.

As you can see, the [Tech Stack section](#tech-stack) includes many different technologies. However, I have included notes and resources for only those I have personally worked with and learnt myself.

Everyone who reads this is welcome to and should choose their own tools/technologies to master.

## GOAL

There is no real goal to this. As a developer, there is nothing better than constant acquisition of knowledge.

In my personal, biased opinion, the only goal for a developer should be to acquire the **knowledge**, **skills** and **tools** to build any ***application*** / ***project*** / ***tool*** they can think of.

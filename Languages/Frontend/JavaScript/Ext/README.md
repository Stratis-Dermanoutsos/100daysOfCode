## Ext - Notes

### Install and create your first app

#### With NPM

1. Gerenate your first project

   ```bash
   ext-gen app -a
   ```

2. Run the app

   ```bash
   cd ./my-app
   npm start
   ```

#### With CMD

1. Gerenate your first project

   ```bash
   sencha generate app --ext MyApp ./MyApp
   ```

2. Run the app

   ```bash
   sencha app watch [classic|modern]
   ```

### Build your App

1. Clean the current build

   ```bash
   sencha app clean <BUILD_TYPE>
   ```

2. Build

   ```bash
   sencha app build <BUILD_TYPE>
   ```

#### Build types

There are 2 main types of builds.

- `production` which is the obvious choice for a complete app, ready to be deployed.

  > This build does not have any debugging potential
- `testing` which is a more dev friendly option.

  This is mostly used when the development is in the very late stages and the app can only be tested after being built and deployed.

  > Great for debugging as errors are understandable

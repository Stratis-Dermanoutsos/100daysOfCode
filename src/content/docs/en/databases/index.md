There are 2 main types of ***databases***:

- #### [SQL](./databases/sql)
- #### [NoSQL](./databases/nosql)

## Basic terminology

| *SQL* | *NoSQL* |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
| database | database |
| table | collection |
| row | document |

## Extra type

However, recently, a new third type has been gaining momentum.
It is none other than:

- #### [NewSQL](./databases/newsql)

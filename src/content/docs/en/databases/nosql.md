description: "This section contains notes on NoSQL databases."

**NoSQL** is a broad category that includes any ***database*** that doesn’t use SQL as its primary data access language. These types of ***databases*** are also sometimes referred to as *non-relational **databases***.

Unlike in relational ***databases***, data in a **NoSQL** ***database*** doesn’t have to conform to a pre-defined schema, so these types of ***databases*** are great for organizations seeking to store unstructured or semi-structured data.

One advantage of **NoSQL *databases*** is that developers can make changes to the ***database*** on the fly, without affecting applications that are using the ***database***.

## MongoDB

Characteristics:

- *Document-oriented*
- ***NoSQL***
- *General Purpose*
- *Flexible* (It offers the ability to make changes quickly and easily)
- *Scalable*
- *Secure* (Authentication and Authorization with a ***MongoDB*** are needed)
- *JSON* (Data is stored in documents, in a key-value pairs format)

Basic commands:

- ### Show *databases*

  ```bash
  show dbs;
  ```

- ### Choose *database* to work on

  > It creates one, if it does not exist

  ```bash
  use name1;
  use testdb1; # example
  ```

  Notice that the newly created ***database*** is not shown in the list generated by the previous command yet. To solve this, simply create a **Collection**.
- ### Show currently working *database*

  ```bash
  db;
  ```

- ### Create new collection

  ```bash
  db.createCollection('name1');
  db.createCollection('collection1'); # example
  ```

- ### Show collections

  ```bash
  show collections;
  ```

- ### Insert data to collection

  ```bash
  db.collection1.insert({key1: 'value1', ...});
  db.collection1.insert({name: 'Stratis'}); # example
  ```

  If the specified **collection** does not exist, it is automatically created. (NOT recommended)
- ### Show data

  ```bash
  db.collection1.find();
  ```

- ### Update data

  ```bash
  db.collection1.update({query1}, {update1}[, {options1}]);
  db.collection1.update({ name: 'Mitsos' }, {name: 'Mitsos', age: 23, height: 1.50}); # Where name = 'Mitsos', set age to 23 and height to 1.50
  ```

- ### Remove data

  ```bash
  db.collection1.remove({query1}, [justOne: true|false]);

  # Examples
  db.collection2.remove({}) # Remove all data from collection2
  db.collection2.remove( { age: { $gt: 10 } } ) # Remove all the documents from collection2 where age is greater than 10
  db.collection2.remove( { age: { $gt: 10 } }, true ) # Remove the first document from collection2 where age is greater than 10
  ```

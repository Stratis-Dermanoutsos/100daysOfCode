## Simple Hello World program

- Create a `helloWorld.java` file

  <Gist gistCode="b29f0911f2c60312781eeaffef349d2e" fileName="hello-world.java" />

- Compile

  <Gist gistCode="b29f0911f2c60312781eeaffef349d2e" fileName="compile.sh" />

- Run

  <Gist gistCode="b29f0911f2c60312781eeaffef349d2e" fileName="run.sh" />

> To run a program in ***Java***, you must first define the *`main`* function as seen above.

## Primitive data types

In ***Java***, there are exactly 8 primitive data types.

| TYPE| DEFAULT | SIZE (in bits) | RANGE OF VALUES |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |
| boolean | false | 1 | true, false |
| char | \u0000 | 16 | [0, 255] ASCII |
| byte | 0 | 8 | [-128, 127] |
| short | 0 | 16 | [-32.768, 32.767] |
| int | 0 | 32 | [-2.147.483.648, 2.147.483.647] |
| long | 0 | 64 | Too large for this table |
| float | 0.0 | 32 | max 7 decimal places |
| double | 0.0 | 64 | max 16 decimal places |

## Modifiers

### Access modifiers

| Access modifier | within class | within package | outside package by subclass only | outside package |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| Private | Yes | No | No | No |
| Default | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Protected | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| Public | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

### Non-Access Modifiers

| Modifier | Description |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
| final | Classes cannot be inherited. Attributes and methods cannot be modified. |
| abstract | To access an abstract class, it must be inherited from another class. Abstract methods are declared without a body. The body is provided by the subclass. |
| static | Attributes and methods are the same for all instances of the class. |
| transient | Attributes and methods are not included when serializing the object. |
| synchronized | Methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time. |
| volatile | The value of an attribute is always read from the "main memory". |

## Record types

A record is also a special class type in ***Java***.
It is intended to be used in places where a class is created only to act as a plain data carrier.

### Defining a record type

***Java*** is simplier that ***C\#*** in the way that it only allows for record definition using positional arguments.

<Gist gistCode="b29f0911f2c60312781eeaffef349d2e" fileName="record-definition.java" />

### Comparing records

The benefit of records over a class is that they are compared based on their values.

<Gist gistCode="b29f0911f2c60312781eeaffef349d2e" fileName="record-equals.java" />

The above example outputs `true` while the following outputs `false`:

<Gist gistCode="b29f0911f2c60312781eeaffef349d2e" fileName="class-equals.java" />

This is because `record` types are compares based on their values, while `class` types are compared based on their references stored in memory.

## Lambda Expressions

### Syntax

<Gist gistCode="b29f0911f2c60312781eeaffef349d2e" fileName="lambda-syntax-1.java" />

Expressions must immediately return a value. Thus, they are limited. To enable the lambda expression to run more commands/statements etc, do this:

<Gist gistCode="b29f0911f2c60312781eeaffef349d2e" fileName="lambda-syntax-2.java" />

### Example use cases

- Print all elements of an array

  <Gist gistCode="b29f0911f2c60312781eeaffef349d2e" fileName="lambda-print-all.java" />

- Run math operations

  <Gist gistCode="b29f0911f2c60312781eeaffef349d2e" fileName="lambda-math.java" />

## Useful code snippets

### Recyclable InputStream

The main problem with the `InputStream` class is that an instance can only be used once in its lifecycle.

A common solution to this is to convert the InputStream to a byte array, then iterate over that array as many times as you need.

For a quick snippet, use the following class:

<Gist gistCode="b29f0911f2c60312781eeaffef349d2e" fileName="recyclable-inputstream.java" />

Usage:

<Gist gistCode="b29f0911f2c60312781eeaffef349d2e" fileName="recyclable-inputstream-demo.java" />

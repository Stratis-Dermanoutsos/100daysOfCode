A module bundler is a tool that takes pieces of JavaScript and their dependencies and bundles them into a single file.

A website is built using multiple tools.
For example, JavaScript, HTML, CSS would be considered the bare minimum.
However, things are a lot more complicated nowadays for a complete website to be built and many languages, tools and libraries are usually needed. To combine them all for optimization and to make sure they all work together is a difficult task. That's where Module bundlers come in.

A module bundler, basically, bundles all the assets used together.

## Webpack

### Get started

- Create a project and make a file ***index.js*** inside a folder ***src***
- Open a terminal in that project's folder and type

  <Gist gistCode="df44c0ddd2f424a2c8f10c1e4f4498c0" fileName="webpack-init.sh" />

  to create a **package.json** file
- Install a module for testing

  <Gist gistCode="df44c0ddd2f424a2c8f10c1e4f4498c0" fileName="webpack-i-lodash.sh" />

- Create a folder ***public*** inside the project's folder and create ***index.html*** file inside this folder and paste

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
      <head>
          <meta charset="utf-8">
          <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
          <title>Document</title>

          <script src="../src/index.js"></script>
      </head>
      <body>

      </body>
  </html>
  ```

- Inside the ***index.js*** file, paste

  <Gist gistCode="df44c0ddd2f424a2c8f10c1e4f4498c0" fileName="webpack-index.js" />

If you open ***index.html*** with a browser and head to the console, you'll notice an error.

- Open a terminal in the project's folder and type

  <Gist gistCode="df44c0ddd2f424a2c8f10c1e4f4498c0" fileName="webpack-install.sh" />

  to install ***Webpack***
- Open the **package.json** file and paste

  <Gist gistCode="df44c0ddd2f424a2c8f10c1e4f4498c0" fileName="webpack-package.json" />

  inside the "*scripts*" section
- Open a terminal in the project's folder and type

  <Gist gistCode="df44c0ddd2f424a2c8f10c1e4f4498c0" fileName="webpack-run-build.sh" />

  to compile our code
- Now, inside the ***index.html***, change the script src attribute like so

  ```html
  <script src="../dist/main.js"></script>
  ```

If you head back to the browser and open the console, you will see a '***helloWorld***' being printed successfully.

It is very important to know that ***Webpack*** is currently using the **DEFAULT** configuration which means that it is specifically looking for the ***index.js*** file inside the ***src*** folder. However, in some cases, you will want/need to configure ***Webpack*** yourself.

- Create a ***webpack.config.js*** file inside our project's folder and paste

  <Gist gistCode="df44c0ddd2f424a2c8f10c1e4f4498c0" fileName="webpack.config.js" />

  Notice, to include many entry points (this is called **CODE SPLITTING**) you need

  <Gist gistCode="df44c0ddd2f424a2c8f10c1e4f4498c0" fileName="splitting-webpack.config.js" />

  More options, for example, **output**

  <Gist gistCode="df44c0ddd2f424a2c8f10c1e4f4498c0" fileName="options-webpack.config.js" />

### Include SASS

- Inside the ***src*** folder, create a file ***style.scss*** and paste your desired or even random ***SCSS*** code

  <Gist gistCode="df44c0ddd2f424a2c8f10c1e4f4498c0" fileName="webpack.scss" />

- Include it in the ***index.js*** file

  <Gist gistCode="df44c0ddd2f424a2c8f10c1e4f4498c0" fileName="webpack-scss-import.js" />

Now, notice that if you try to build with

<Gist gistCode="df44c0ddd2f424a2c8f10c1e4f4498c0" fileName="webpack-run-build.sh" />

an error will occure. That's because we do not have a loader for our ***SASS***.

To solve this, simply open a terminal in the project's folder and type

<Gist gistCode="df44c0ddd2f424a2c8f10c1e4f4498c0" fileName="webpack-sass-install.sh" />

- Include the modules in the ***webpack.config.js*** file, inside the *"module.exports"* section. The end result should look like this

  <Gist gistCode="df44c0ddd2f424a2c8f10c1e4f4498c0" fileName="end-webpack.config.js" />

### Analyze bundle (using plugins)

- Open a terminal in the project's folder and type

  <Gist gistCode="df44c0ddd2f424a2c8f10c1e4f4498c0" fileName="webpack-analyzer-install.sh" />

- Paste

  <Gist gistCode="df44c0ddd2f424a2c8f10c1e4f4498c0" fileName="webpack-analyzer-require.js" />

  in the ***webpack.config.js*** file, outside of the *"module.exports"* section and

  <Gist gistCode="df44c0ddd2f424a2c8f10c1e4f4498c0" fileName="webpack-analyzer-include.js" />

  inside the section.
- When you build, you should see this screen

  ![webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stratis-Dermanoutsos/Full-Stack-Notes/main/Images/webpack-bundle-analyzer.png)

### Setup local web server

- Open a terminal in the project's folder and type

  <Gist gistCode="df44c0ddd2f424a2c8f10c1e4f4498c0" fileName="webpack-local-server-install.sh" />

- In the ***webpack.config.js*** file, outside of the *"module.exports"* section, paste

  <Gist gistCode="df44c0ddd2f424a2c8f10c1e4f4498c0" fileName="local-server-webpack.config.js" />

- Open the **package.json** file and paste

  <Gist gistCode="df44c0ddd2f424a2c8f10c1e4f4498c0" fileName="webpack-local-server-package.json" />

  inside the *"scripts"* section
- Start server by typing

  <Gist gistCode="df44c0ddd2f424a2c8f10c1e4f4498c0" fileName="webpack-local-server-run-dev.sh" />

  inside the terminal

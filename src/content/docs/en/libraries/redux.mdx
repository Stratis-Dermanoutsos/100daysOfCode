***Redux*** is a ***JavaScript*** library for managing the state of your application.

Big applications have big application states and managing them gets more and more inconvenient as your app grows. This is where state management libraries like ***Redux*** come in.

***Redux*** follows a pattern called “*Single Source Of Truth*”, which means that we have only one place (called **Store**) where we store the only state for the whole application.

To create a `react-redux` project:

<Gist gistCode="cb8f2eae341252880e83e5816d235c8d" fileName="init.sh" />

***Redux*** has 3 main parts:

- [**Actions**](#actions)
- [**Reducers**](#reducers)
- [**Store**](#store)

## Actions

**Actions** are ***JavaScript*** objects that describe *WHAT* happened, but not *HOW* the app state changes.

We just send (dispatch) them to τhe **store** instance whenever we want to update the state of our application. The rest is handled by the **reducers**.

***Redux*** requires our **action** objects to contain a type field. This field is used to describe what kind of **action** we are dispatching and it should usually be a constant that you export from a file. More fields can be added in the **action** object and are completely up to the developer.

Example **action**:

<Gist gistCode="cb8f2eae341252880e83e5816d235c8d" fileName="action.js" />

This **action** in activated when the user clicks the "*Add Note*" button and informs the **store** that we want to add a new Note.

### Action Creators

They are functions that generate and return plain ***JavaScript*** objects.

The above **action** can be written as

<Gist gistCode="cb8f2eae341252880e83e5816d235c8d" fileName="action-creators.js" />

## Reducers

***Reducers*** are functions that define *HOW* the app state changes. In other words, they recalculate the new application state.

Whenever an **action** is dispatched to the **store**, the **action** gets passed to the **reducer**.

The **reducer** function takes two parameters:

- the previous app state
- the **action** being dispatched

It returns the new app state.

<Gist gistCode="cb8f2eae341252880e83e5816d235c8d" fileName="reducer.js" />

To deal with **reducer** complexity, we chunk them down in multiple, simpler **reducers** and later, we combine them with a ***Redux*** helper function called `combineReducers`.

The main reducer is conventionally called “*Root Reducer*”.

## Store

The **store** hold the state of the application.

It is actually an object, NOT a class.

It is possible to create multiple **stores**, this is against the pattern that ***Redux*** follows. We create only one **store** per application!

The values to be stored in it are completely up to the developer and they can be nested as much as needed.

## Store Provider

It is VERY important to give a provider to the App so it knows where the state is being stored.

This is quite simple and can be achieved by encapsulating the `<App />` component instance inside the Provider like so:

- Go to *index.(js|tsx)*
- Include the store and the Provider

  <Gist gistCode="cb8f2eae341252880e83e5816d235c8d" fileName="store-provider-import.js" />

- Change

  ```javascript
  <App />
  ```

  to

  <Gist gistCode="cb8f2eae341252880e83e5816d235c8d" fileName="store-provider.jsx" />

## Setup example

A convenient ***Redux*** file tree setup is

```
redux/
|- actions/
|  |- actions.js
|- reducers/
|  |- reducers.js
|- store/
|  |- store.js
```

or, my personal choice,

```
src/
|- app/
|  |- store.js
|- slices/
|  |- ...
|- components/
|  ...
```

## Simple todo project template

The template we'll use is the following (JavaScript)

```
src/
|- app/
|  |- store.js
|- slices/
|  |- todosSlice.js
|- components/
|  |- Todos.jsx
|- App.js
|  ...
```

### src/

#### app/

##### store.js

<Gist gistCode="cb8f2eae341252880e83e5816d235c8d" fileName="store.js" />

#### slices/

##### todosSlice.js

<Gist gistCode="cb8f2eae341252880e83e5816d235c8d" fileName="todosSlice.js" />

#### components/

##### Todos.jsx

<Gist gistCode="cb8f2eae341252880e83e5816d235c8d" fileName="Todos.jsx" />

#### App.js

<Gist gistCode="cb8f2eae341252880e83e5816d235c8d" fileName="App.js" />

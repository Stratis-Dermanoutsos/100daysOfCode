In computer programming, a framework is a set of pre-written code that provides a common structure, guidelines, and functionality for building software applications. It is essentially a reusable template or blueprint that developers can use to build software quickly and efficiently.

Frameworks typically provide a foundation of code and functionality that can be extended and customized to meet the specific needs of a particular application. They often include libraries of pre-written code that developers can use to perform common tasks such as accessing databases, handling user input, and communicating with other systems.

Frameworks can help to streamline the development process by reducing the amount of code that developers need to write from scratch. They can also help to ensure that applications are built in a consistent manner, which can make them easier to maintain and update over time.

***Bootstrap*** is a popular front-end ***CSS*** framework developed by **Twitter**.
It provides a set of pre-written ***CSS*** and ***JavaScript*** files that developers can use to build responsive, mobile-first web applications quickly and easily.

To use ***Bootstrap***, visit the [official documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/download/).

> Note that ***Bootstrap*** requires ***HTML5*** doctype to work.

***Bootstrap*** is developed mobile first, a strategy in which we optimize code for mobile devices first and then scale up components as necessary using ***CSS*** media queries. To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming for all devices, add the responsive viewport meta tag to your *\<head>*.

Basically, ***Bootstrap*** uses pre-defined classes that you asign to each element from within your ***HTML*** code. In this aspect, it is similar to ***Tailwind CSS*** but their use cases may differ.

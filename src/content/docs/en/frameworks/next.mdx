***Next.js*** is a popular open-source ***React***-based framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated web applications.
It provides a set of tools and conventions that make it easy to build scalable, high-performance web applications.

***Next.js*** is built on top of ***React*** and ***Node.js***, and it adds several features that make it well-suited for building complex web applications.

Some of its key features include:

- *Server-side rendering*: ***Next.js*** supports server-side rendering of ***React*** components, which can improve the initial load time of web pages and make them more search engine friendly.
- *Automatic code splitting*: ***Next.js*** automatically splits application code into smaller chunks, which can improve performance by reducing the amount of code that needs to be loaded by the browser.
- *Static site generation*: ***Next.js*** can generate static ***HTML*** pages at build time, which can improve performance and reduce server load.
- *File-based routing*: ***Next.js*** provides a simple and intuitive way to handle routing in web applications, based on the file system structure.
- *API routes*: ***Next.js*** makes it easy to create serverless ***API*** endpoints that can be used by client-side code to fetch data from external sources.

***React Native*** is a ***JavaScript*** framework that uses ***React*** to build **native** applications for iOS and Android or web applications, all with 1 code base.

While it shares the **JSX** syntax with ***React***, the components and overall logic used are quite different.

## Basic App.js template

<Gist gistCode="2b192ecdd9213f18fca22b72c30fab2e" fileName="react-native-basic-app.js" />

> The above `App.js` was generated using **Expo**.

## Components

All components are written in ***JSX*** as in ***React***.

For both Android and iOS applications, a **view** is the building block of UI. Everything, from a simple line to complex designs are all different kinds of views.

Usually, when developing an app for Android, you use ***Kotlin*** or ***Java***. For iOS, the norm is ***Swift*** or ***Objective-C***. ***React Native*** supports components for both of these platforms. These are called *Native Components*.

Also, ***React Native*** has many *native components* that are ready-to-use out of the box. These are called *Core Components*.

## Styling

There is no ***CSS*** in ***React Native***.

Instead, styles are defined using `StyleSheet.create()` method which accepts a ***JS*** object as parameter.

E.g.:

<Gist gistCode="2b192ecdd9213f18fca22b72c30fab2e" fileName="react-native-styles.js" />

This specific `container` styling is then called using the following format:

<Gist gistCode="2b192ecdd9213f18fca22b72c30fab2e" fileName="react-native-view.js" />

## Platform

As more than 1 platforms are natively supported in a single code base, it is only natural that we might want some components to only render in one.

For that, we use the `Platform` module.

Code example:

<Gist gistCode="2b192ecdd9213f18fca22b72c30fab2e" fileName="react-native-platform.js" />

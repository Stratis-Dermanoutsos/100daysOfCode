## MVC - Notes

***MVC*** is known as an architectural pattern, which embodies three parts ***M*odel**, ***V*iew** and ***C*ontroller**. To be more exact it divides the application into three logical parts: the **model**, the **view** and the **controller**.

It has three main components:

- ***M*odel**

  It is responsible for maintaining data. The **model** is actually connected to the database. Adding or retrieving data is done in the **model** component.

  It responds to the **controller** requests because the **controller** doesn't access the database by itself. The **model** communicates with the database and then gives the needed data to the **controller**.

  Note: the **model** never communicates with the **view** directly.
- ***V*iew**

  Data representation is done by the **view** component. It actually generates **UI** (**U**ser **I**nterface) for the user. So, at web applications think of the **view** component as the ***HTML*** and ***CSS***.

  **Views** are created by the data which is collected by the **model** component. However, the data itself is not fetched directly from the **model** component but through the **controller**.

  Note: the **view** only communicates with the **controller**.
- ***C*ontroller**

  The **controller** is the component that enables the interconnection between the **view** and the **model** so it acts as an intermediary.

  The **controller** doesnâ€™t have to worry about handling data logic, it just tells the **model** what to do. After receiving data from the **model** it processes it and then it sends all that information to the **view** and explains how to present this data to the user.

  Note: **views** and **models** cannot communicate directly.

Advantages of ***MVC***

- Components are reusable
- Easy to maintain
- Different components of the ***MVC*** application can be independently deployed and maintained
- This architecture helps test components independently

Disadvantages of ***MVC***

- The complexity is high
- Not suitable for small applications
- The inefficiency of data access in view

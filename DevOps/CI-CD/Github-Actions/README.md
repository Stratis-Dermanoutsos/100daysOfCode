## Github Actions - Notes

### Types of Actions

Actions come in two types:

- (Docker) **container actions**

  They allow the environment to be packaged with the ***GitHub Actions*** code and can only execute in the GitHub-Hosted Linux environment.
- ***JavaScript* actions**

### Workflow Files

Workflows are defined in special files in the *`.github/workflows`* directory, named *`main.yml`*.

Workflows can execute based on your chosen event.

Inside a workflow file, several declarations take place.

- Name

      name: workflow_name
  This name appears on any pull request or in the Actions tab. The name is especially useful when there are multiple workflows in your repository.
- Event

      on: event
  It indicates that your workflow will execute anytime the specified event is triggered.

  For example,

      on: push
- Actions

  Workflows piece together jobs, and jobs piece together steps.

  Actions can be used from within the same repository, from any other public repository, or from a published Docker container image.

  An action block can contain:
  - Jobs

        jobs:
    It is the base component of a workflow run.
  - Build

        build:
    It's the identifier we're attaching to this job.
  - Name

        name: action_name
    It's the name of the job, this is displayed on GitHub when the workflow is running.
  - Runs On

        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    Defines the type of machine to run the job on. The machine can be either a GitHub-hosted runner or a self-hosted runner.
  - Steps

        steps:
    A linear sequence of operations that make up a job.
  - Uses

        uses: actions/checkout@v1
    Uses a community action called checkout to allow the workflow to access the contents of the repository.

        uses: ./dir
    Provides the relative path to the action in the *`dir`* directory of the repository.
  - Input variables

        with:
          VARIABLE_1: "value"
          VARIABLE_2: "val"
    It's used to specify the input variables that will be available to your action in the runtime environment.

### Following the **GitHub Actions: Hello World** course

I will take note of the procedure of the course to be able to look back at it for any reference I might need.

#### Step 1: Add a Dockerfile

- Create a file titled *`action-a/Dockerfile`*
  - Create a new branch. Branches should be named intentionally, so a good name for this branch could be *`first-action`*
  - On the new branch, create a directory: *`action-a`*
  - In the *`action-a`* directory, create a file titled *`Dockerfile`*
- Inside the *`Dockerfile`*, paste

      FROM debian:9.5-slim

      ADD entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
      RUN chmod +x /entrypoint.sh
      ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
- Commit your file
- Open a pull request with your new branch against main

#### Step 2: Add an entrypoint script

<ins>Note</ins>: An entrypoint script must exist in our repository so that Docker has something to execute.

- As a part of this branch and pull request, create a file in the *`action-a`* directory titled *`entrypoint.sh`*
- Inside the *`entrypoint.sh`*, paste

      #!/bin/sh -l

      sh -c "echo Hello world my name is $INPUT_MY_NAME"
  In this file, all we're doing is outputting a "Hello world" message using an environment variable called **MY_NAME**.
- Stage and commit the changes
- Push the changes to GitHub

#### Step 3: Add an action metadata file

- As a part of this branch and pull request, create a file titled *`action-a/action.yml`*
- Inside it, paste

      name: "Hello Actions"
      description: "Greet someone"
      author: "octocat@github.com"

      inputs:
      MY_NAME:
          description: "Who to greet"
          required: true
          default: "World"

      runs:
      using: "docker"
      image: "Dockerfile"

      branding:
      icon: "mic"
      color: "purple"
- Stage and commit the changes
- Push the changes to GitHub

#### Step 4: Start your workflow file

- Create a file titled *`.github/workflows/main.yml`*
- Inside the file, paste

      name: A workflow for my Hello World file
      on: push
- Stage and commit the changes
- Push the changes to GitHub

#### Step 5: Run an action from your workflow file

- As a part of this branch and pull request, edit *`.github/workflows/main.yml`* to append the following content:

      jobs:
        build:
          name: Hello world action
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v1
            - uses: ./action-a
              with:
                MY_NAME: "Mona"
- Stage and commit the changes
- Push the changes to GitHub

#### Step 6: Trigger the workflow

- Go to the repository on ***GitHub***
- Navigate to

      Actions -> 'Added action to run' -> 'Hello world action' -> 'Run /./action-a'
- At the bottom of the stdout, you should see the string "Hello world my name is Mona"

#### Step 7: Incorporate the workflow

- Merge this pull request
- Delete your branch
